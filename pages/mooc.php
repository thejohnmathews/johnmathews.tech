            <h2>Different Modes of Transportation</h2>

            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Subject Area:</strong> English Basics</li>
                <li><strong>Level:</strong> Infantíl - 3 to 5 years old</li>
                <li><strong>Resources and Digital Tools:</strong> Google Slides Presentation, Paper Activity</li>
                <li><strong>Time Needed:</strong> 5-10 minute presentation, 5 minute paper activity</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p> I am an english language assistant for 3-5 year old children (infantíl) at CEIP Eugenio Maria de Hostos.
                Typically, the English lessons for the infantíl level revolve around simple and generalized topics that they already
                understand in Spanish. Through my experience observing my bilingual teachers, both digital (presentations, songs, games) and 
                physical (objects, activity sheets, and crafts) activities taught over a week is all it takes to instill new knowledge.

                I wanted a topic that was simple and widely used, so I chose "Different Types of Transportation". 
                My final project consists of a mostly visual presentation filled with transport such as: cars, trains, buses,
                airplanes, etc. The presentation also contains a YouTube song and a Genially interactive game. Additionally,
                the project has a physical paper activity.

            <h2>Rationale and Objectives</h2>

            <h4>Objective</h4>
            <p> The goal of this project is to discover and learn necessary English vocabulary that will
                help them navigate the world when they are older. The children should be able to connect
                and verbalize the English translation of common modes of transportation. 
            </p>
            <p> In this lesson, the language assistant should take charge with the bilingual teacher
                as support. The language assistant will teach the presentation and introduce the paper
                activity afterwards. The bilingual teacher will provide support for students who need
                questions answered in Spanish.
            </p>

            <h4>Rationale</h4>
            <p> Throughout my limited experience teaching children english as a second language (ESO), I have noticed 
                that most lessons revolve around a presentation introducing images of words and having the children repeat them out loud.
                Typically, the children will shout out the Spanish translation of a word. In return, the teachers emphasize
                vocalizing the English translation of the specified word. This process allows for the children to associate
                the Spanish and English translation of a word together.
            </p>
            <p> The presentation I described above is useful for children who are primarily visual and auditory learners.
                In order to help young kinesthetic learners, my lesson comes with a paper activity where the kids
                color and write (trace) the names of the new vocabulary. By incorporating elements of all the 
                learning styles, most kids will be able to retain the English translation of modes of transportation.
            </p>

            <h2>Presentation</h2>

            <p> For the presentation, have the kids sit in a circle around the screen so that everyone can see.
                Take the time to explain to the kids what the subject of the presentation is: "Different Types of Transportation".
                Whenever a new mode of transporation appears, ask the children if they know the term in English. If no one knows,
                say the term and make sure the kids vocalize the mode of transportation. At the end of the slideshow, you
                can ask the kids questions, such as which mode of transport is their favorite. Additionally, you can play the interactive game or song at the end
                of the presentation to reinforce the material.

            <h2>Paper Activity</h2>
            <p> For the paper activity, explain to the kids in English that they need to color each mode of transportation and
                trace (write) the names of each. While the children are working on the activity page, ask and encourage
                kids to say each term in English.
